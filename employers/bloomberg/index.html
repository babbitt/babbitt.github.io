    <p>I’ve been incredibly lucky and honored to have interned at Bloomberg L.P. for the last 5 summers. I’ve been able to learn firsthand what real-world software engineering looks like and have created and rolled out consumer-facing features.</p>

<h3 id="2021">2021</h3>
<h6 id="hybrid-due-to-covid-19---security-operations">Hybrid due to COVID-19 - Security Operations</h6>
<p>My work this past summer with Security Operations touches on sensitive topics to report on online. That being said I’m happy to say that I was able to overhaul a major aspect of our physical visitor security system and that my improvements were well received by the team!</p>

<h6 id="london-remote-due-to-covid-19---communication-channels-team">London (Remote due to COVID-19) - Communication Channels team</h6>
<p>Returning to Communication Channels this summer, I worked on Bloomberg’s Message platform to bring message threading in an attempt to tame rowdy inboxes. As a full-stack project, I worked with multiple teams including MSG frontend, MSG backend, &amp; UX, in addition to key stakeholders.</p>

<h3 id="2019">2019</h3>
<h6 id="new-york---internal-applications-team">New York - Internal Applications team</h6>
<p>I was embedded within the internal and customer support department to re-develop a telephony service application. Working with users, I was responsible for the UI/UX development in addition to functionality. In 8 weeks I delivered a functioning prototype that was ready for redeployment in production applications.</p>

<h3 id="2018">2018</h3>
<h6 id="new-york---communication-channels-team">New York - Communication Channels team</h6>
<p>My second summer I was placed in Bloomberg’s communications department within the proprietary messaging platform team (Instant Bloomberg). Working with a mentor, I developed two client-facing features which are in production. I also delved into the core app functionality to fix bugs and improve testing suite performance by over 25%.</p>

<h3 id="2017">2017</h3>
<h6 id="new-york---fixed-income-team">New York - Fixed Income team</h6>
<p>In my first year at Bloomberg, I worked within a small team that had identified a break in their development workflow. I worked with them to implement a financial validation layer that connected their development pipeline into one continuous process and is still in use today.</p>
