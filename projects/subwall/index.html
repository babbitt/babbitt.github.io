        Subwall: The subway map, but more complicated.

        <p><span class="section-title">It all starts</span> back when I was probably 10-11. Growing up in NYC I had this facination with the subway given that it was always such a huge part of my life. For those not from the city or unfamilar with our Subway. The NYC MTA Subway system is a sprawling transportation system that runs under all 4 intra-connected boroughs, conencting them, and allowing New Yorkers fast transport around the city. The 850 miles and 36 lines that make up the system are the result of hundreds of years of competition, cooperation, and innovation to better connect the city. Here's the part where I could go on a tangent about how the subway is a great equalizer, forcing all New Yorkers to use it due to it's unmatched efficiency, but that's better left for a thesis than a technical writeup.</p>
        <p>In high school my relationship with the subway became a lot more fleshed out, I suddently didn't just see the system as lines on a map, but rather for all of the quirks of how it opperated. Riding the trains across the city every day (nearly 4 hours a day), gave me way too much time to gain interest in the system, ultimately leading to this project, which sat on the backburner of my project list, until quarentine came around and gave me all the time I could fathom to make it.</p>
        <p><span class="section-title">Before there were trains, there was a map.</span>Well, more specifically, before there was a subway, it had to be built, but that doesn't make for a very good title. Point being, if I want to have a subway map on my wall, I need a map too. The issue here is that creating my map won't be as simple as just going to a station and picking up an MTA map.</p>
        <p>The biggest issue is the medium I'll be using. LED strips are great, cheap, easy to buy/use in bulk, but very straight. The system naturally has sweeeping turns and curves underground as trains cris-cross the city and avoid uneven ground, buildings, and other obsticles. This brings me to my first lie to you, I'm not really making a map. In fact, the MTA is lying to you too, the official map of the subway isn't much of a map either. It's actually a diagram of the system, even the MTA didn't bother plotting out the system to scale. Feel free to check out <a href="https://www.vanshnookenraggen.com/_index/docs/NYC_full_trackmap.pdf">a really great map by cartographer Andrew Lynch</a>, who I'm sure you've heard of if this isn't your first run in with the subway map.</p>
        <p>So this leaves me with a big problem, how do I create a diagram of the subway that doesn't curve. Well actually, lucky for me, the MTA actually did the hard work for me. Back in 1972, the MTA contracted out Massimo Vignelli to create a new subway map. The result was a map with a strange, and offputting to most, combination of straight lines and rounded corners. Although it was almost universally disliked by strap-hangers, the design continued to float around circles of designers and subway enthusiests. In 2008, the MTA called upon Vignelli once again to give the design a second shot, update it for the 21st century, and give it a shot on their new online map, The Weekender. Not only was the map a hit, but it cleaned up the design, making it almost a perfect fit for my map. </p>
        <p><span class="section-title">There was just one big issue</span> with the 2008 map. It was too complicated. See, I'm dedicated to the project, but not like $1000 dedicated. Since the MTA has multiple services that use the same tracks (or track parallel to each other inches away) the Vignelli represents each service with it's own line. The investment for that many LEDs, not to mention the technical challenges I would face, were a bit too much for me to handle. So I decided I'd save myself the hassle and give myself the bigger hassle of redrawing the map, my way.</p>
        <p>At first I thought this would be a straightforward task, just open up Illustrator, and draw over the lines, right? Eh, not so much. Because, in case you couldn't tell, I seem to hate myself, I decided I wouldn't just be giving the map any old trim, but rather holding myself to some golden rules of the subway, as not to botch the system with my simplification. I think of it like lossless compression for maps. I've done my best to preserve all the detail*, just use less resources.</p>
        <p>And so I went to work with a few golden rules:
            <ul>
                <li>Don't concatinate number track with letter track*<su>Unless there's not enough space to fit two strips side by side</su></li>
                <li>Do concatinate tracks even if they're from different colors if they run paralell.</li>
                <li>Use the minimum number of LEDs, clever tricks are allowed</li>
                <li>Staten island doesn't count. The SIR is NOT a subway, you can not change my mind on this. Why do you only pay at some stops?? Why is it entirely above ground??? It has 0 transfers. No, it's not being included. (Also it doesn't fit nicely on my wall, sorry :( )</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The first itteration was solid enough. I nailed down all the main lines and figured out where I would have to compromise. The issue is that while I loved the green neon lines, I wanted a way of better visualizing what I created, and corrupted the file in the process of converting the lines to LED strip drawings. So I set to work on V2, but this time I had some more in mind given my experience. First and foremost, I reached out to Ian Reynolds, who's been a super great resource and crazy enough to do it 5 years ago in Boston, giving me no reason to back down without looking like a fool. In our conversations, electronics suddenly became much more of a consideration, between figuring out what was electronically feasbile and within spec for the WS2812 LEDs I'd be using from a data perspective. For this reason, I opted to split the map up into what I coined "Runs". Each run has little to no corrolation to the actual MTA services, but rather allows me to install the strip in more managable sections, with considerations for power and data. In total, my map has 10 runs of varying length, created basically from whatever I thought went together. If there was one place I think this map can be optimized, this is the lowest hanging fruit. If someone wants to write an algorithm to determine breakpoints on the map that groups LED efficiently while optimizing for power and data starting in south Brooklyn, I'm all ears.</p>
