Although the Binghamton course registration system is designed to be a meritocracy with the highest credit holders registering first, in practice this is not always the case. Particularly, in the Department of Computer Science, there is a constant issue of classes being issued with fewer seats than students who are required to take the class. Although nobody is quite sure of the reason, this results in seats being released at random intervals by our dean, with everyone fighting for spots. To gain a leg up on everyone else pressing refresh, my friend Henry originally had the idea for the [Binghamton Course Sniper](https://github.com/HenryBurns/CoRE_project) back in April of 2018. (With his permission of course,) I picked up his code in April of 2020 and made some improvements to the concept to be more user-friendly and update it to work with the university's constantly changing system.

Some improvements include: 
* Comprehensive Documentation of usage (README and usage help menu)
* Complete code refactor, decreasing repo size by 85%
* Easy command-line interface
* Ability to receive registration updates through various providers
    * [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/)
