Soups On was the final project I completed with [Samuel Piltch](https://samuelpiltch.com/). Our idea was to simplify lunch in the city.

The equation is simple. You have friends, you need to eat, eating alone sucks. The issue that compounds the complexity of this equation are the endless restaurant options, weird friend group dynamics, and of course the scheduling nightmare that becomes any get-together.

Soup's on aimed to solve this by taking the pressure off of the user and leaving the work up to our algorithms. Each morning, you would be asked a set of simple questions, things like:
* How adventurous are you feeling?
* What times are you free / do you prefer?
* What size group are you looking for?
* Close friends only or acquaintances?
* What cuisine are you feeling about and at what budget?

etc...

We would then take these responses in addition to a predetermined list of restaurants you like and a friends list you set up and make lunch plans for you. Later that morning, you would receive a notification regarding who you've been paired up with and where you're meeting based on friends who answered similarly. As a group, you can then decide if the location is to your liking and head out to lunch.
