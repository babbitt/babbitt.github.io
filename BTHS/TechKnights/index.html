                                <h2>The Brooklyn TechKnights</h2>
                                <p> For the entirety of my high school career I was a proud member of our school's FIRST
                                    robotics team, The Brooklyn TechKnights.
                                </p>
                                <br><br>
                                <p> Competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition, our team was tasked with designing, fabricating, electrifying, and programming a robot from scratch each year. During my tenure, we constructed robots ranging from 3-10 feet tall, all over 120 pounds. For the first three years, I participated as a part of our programming team and acted as the lead of our Public Relations team, rebuilding it from the ground up.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p> In 2019, I was lucky enough to serve as captain of the team as elected by my peers. During the 2019 season we built our most successful robot of my tenure, Freefall. Measuring in at 10 feet extended and a mere 103 pounds. It was our most lethal robot to date. It features over 1500 lbs of torque and a lifting elevator that moves at 10m/s which can carry over 100lbs. I encourage you to check out our <a
