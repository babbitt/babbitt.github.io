    <p>As a kid, I always loved the theatre, but mostly because of all the cool “tech” that powered a performance. I would always be looking away from the stage, trying to see how the lights were set up, or what speakers were where. When I got to college and heard that we had a student-run event production company, I was hooked.</p>

<p>In the Fall of 2019, I was hired to <a href="https://bssl.binghamtonsa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binghamton Sound Stage and Lighting</a> (BSSL) as a Lighting Engineer. I would help set up and breakdown for events, and eventually (after some training), run the board and do live busking for events.</p>

<p>After a year at the company, I was elected as the Lighting Shop Tech. Given my time in a metal shop in high school, I was handy around tools and a soldering iron, so I was tasked with maintenance and troubleshooting our equipment. Even though events were few and far between in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, I did a full audit of our equipment, re-organized our shop, and consulted and help set up our newest lighting system (we very much look forward to using it this year!)</p>

<p>I also helped consult/work Moefest, <a href="/nontechnical/whrw/">WHRW’s</a> annual music festival. I was responsible for extra-organizational communication, helped set up our equipment for the gig, and even ran the lighting board for a bit.</p>

<p>I’ve also been working on some custom software for BSSL, (<a href="/employers/slugs/">come find out more about that</a>).</p>
