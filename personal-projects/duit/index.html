<meta name="description" content="Düit is an idea I’ve been kicking around for quite a while. My goal is to streamline the planning of the college experience so people can spend more time…. doing college things. I’ve found that time management and written records are key to keeping up in school, work, and even social obligations. The issue is that the planning required not only takes forever but also happens across a slew of services. Even worse is integrating with friends or other providers (be that professors or employers). My goal with Düit is to bring all of these tasks under one intelligent roof. The project is ongoing largely in the planning phase, as I figure out my organizational methods and how I can apply them." />
