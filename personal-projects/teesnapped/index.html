<meta name="description" content="TeeSnapped is less of a full on project then it was an excuse to get back to my hackathon roots. I noticed one day while helping someone book a tee-time that the network requests TeeSnap uses to set up reservations seemed a bit wonky. I did some digging and realized that while the UI may have stopped you from placing a reservation before a certain time, there was nothing in the AJAX request being made to stop you. Hence, TeeSnapped was born. The site takes some basic info about the course you play to generate a AJAX request and then leverages the javascript execution available in Bookmarks to get around CORS and take you to the booking page. It’s pretty simple all said and done." />
