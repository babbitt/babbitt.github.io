                                <h2>Boy Scouts of America</h2>
                                <p>
                                    For 8 years I was a member of Troop 662 in Manhattan, New York. 
                                    During my time in the Boy Scouts I learned how to be an effective leader, complete tasks when faced with adversity, essential life skills, and of course, all the outdoor skills we're known for.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Over the course of my tenure with the troop I held multiple leadership positions, ranging from quartermaster all the way to Junior Assistant ScoutMaster.
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a part of the process of gaining the rank of Eagle, I had to plan, execute, and reflect upon a project of my choosing that would enrich my local community. In 2017, I worked with a senior center specializing in alzheimer's care. Working in tandem with their needs and my skillset, I created a computer program that automatically generated personalized weekly newsletters for all residents. Each newsletter was personally tailored based on a questionnaire and data generated by scout interviews with the residents. The program  was implemented as deigned and currently services over 75 residents.
