            I've been working with Fairly since their inception as their "Lead Engineer" but with all the hats I wear I think of it more as "The dude who handles the computers". Fairly provides an online platform to lower your property taxes, and I work with the 2 co-founders to make that happen.

            Responsiblities
        </h4>
        <p style="margin: 0;">I handle basically everything that a user deals with when they come to our site. This has allowed me to dabble into areas including</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Design</li>
            <li>Full Stack Web Apps</li>
            <li>Database Administration</li>
            <li>AWS</li>
            <li>System Architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We've just finished up our "beta" so expect more from us as we build out our platform over the next quarter.</p>
        <h4>MVP</h4>
        <p>When Jay & James first called me up, they just had an idea and a few screengrabs of what the site should provide. This was right up my alley, allowing me not only to work on designing out a product for them, but also creating a brand identity for the company to grow into. Although I'm no graphic designer, it's always a fun exercise and even better to see it to fruition. Below are some images of the finalized MVP site launched.</p>
