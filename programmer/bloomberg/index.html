        <p>
            I've been incredibly lucky and honored to have interned at Bloomberg L.P. for the last 4 summers. I've been able to learn firsthand what real world software engineering looks like and have created and rolled out consumer facing features.
        </p>
        <h4>2017</h4>
        <h6>New York - Fixed Income team</h6>
        <p>My first year at Bloomberg I worked within a small team that had identified a break in their development workflow. I worked with them to implement a financial validation layer which connected their development pipeline into one continuous process, and is still in use today.</p>
        <h4>2018</h4>
        <h6>New York - Communication Channels team</h6>
        <p>My second summer I was placed in Bloomberg's communications department within the proprietary messaging platform team (Instant Bloomberg). Working with a mentor, I developed two client facing features which are in production. I also delved into the core app functionality to fix bugs and improve testing suite performance by over 25%.</p>
        <h4>2019</h4>
        <h6>New York - Internal Applications team</h6>
        <p>I was embedded within the internal and customer support department to re-develop a telephony service application. Working with users, I was responsible for the UI/UX development in addition to functionality. In 8 weeks I delivered a functioning prototype which was ready for redeployment in production applications.</p>
        <h4>2020</h4>
        <h6>London (New York / Remote due to COVID-19) - Communication Channels team</h6>
        <p>Returning to Communication Channels this summer, I worked on Bloomberg's Message platform to bring message threading in an attempt to tame rowdy inboxes. As a full stack project, I worked with multiple teams including: MSG frontend, MSG backend, & UX, in addition to key stakeholders.</p>
