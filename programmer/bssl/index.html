        <p>
            In the fall of 2019 I started working at BSSL (Binghamton Sound Stage and Lighting) as a Lighting Engineer, working local events. This spring, I was appointed the Lighting Shop Tech. Having a position on the E-board, I couldn't resist throwing my CS hat in the ring and offering my services to the company. Namely, I noticed how disorganized our booking and staffing system was, and aimed to replace the myriad of Google sheets, Post-It's, and texts with a unified custom system. Hence, SLUGS was born.
        </p>
        <h4>SLUGS</h4>
        <p>S.L.U.G.S (or if you're in need of an acronym the SeLective User Grouping System) is now the online home for BSSL employees. It allows managers to book, manage, staff, process, and bill shows. Employees also benefit with a streamlined timeclock, availability schedule, and a day of show view. All available on their mobile device.</p>
        <p>From a software perspective, I created this project to get a little more leverage on understanding full stack applications and building out systems that work to maximize efficiency and minimize hassle. My personal interests lie in improving life with software, and this is a very real example of that in action.</p>
        <p>The web app is built using Django, with integrations to Quickbooks, Google Calendar. Source is available on Github.</p>
