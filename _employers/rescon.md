Although less of a programming role. I currently work as a "Rescon" (Residential Computer Consultant). Originally an effort spearheaded by CoRE (my housing community), we make sure that everyone on campus has the access they need and act as house call tech support. 

It's a pretty bog-standard IT job with added house calls. That's all I got. The rest of my jobs have been super cool, go check those out!
