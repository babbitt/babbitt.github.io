        <p>In 2014 I participated in my school's 7th grade science fair. Intrigued by electronics more than life science, I convinced my teacher to bend the rules and allow me to submit a project involving electronics as long as it involed me, a living human. I submitted a prototye for an piezo-electric phone charger, that exploited a property found in piezo discs, allow them to create small amounts of energy when deformed/compressed, such as when stepped upon.</p>
        <p>Although the prototype was more of a demonstation of the phenominon than a full on product. It worked on paper. I put together the materials, and got some shotty, inconclusive results.  When the scientific method didn't shine down on me for my brilliance (or really lack there of), I pivoted and exploited what science fairs are really about, scientific education, and put on a show. I had interactive demos we're people could power LEDs by messing with the discs, deconstructed diagrams, and even an underwater demo to show the resilence of the tech (tap water just isn't very conductive at low wattage, but people don't know that ðŸ¤«). I was banking my project on the hope that this could be a way to product green, clean energy.<br>To my surprise, It worked. I wowwed some middle school parents and the panel of judges, winning both my school's science fair and the inter-yeshiva conference, the highest level our school competed at.</p>
        <p>Following the science-fair, my teacher informed me about a competition she heard about for innovations in clean energy, specifically to help Nat-Geo's photographers in the field. I submitted my project, talked with some lovely people at Nat-Geo, and won! I got to exhibit my ideas to Nat-Geo engineers, photographers, and thousands of kids watching via livestream.</p>
        <a style="font-size: 1.25em;" href="/awards/maker-faire">Just when I thought one random idea couldn't take me any further, I received a phone call 2 months later from my contact at Nat-Geo on behalf of the White House.</a>
