        <p><a href="/awards/nat-geo">After a crazy spring</a>, I recieved one last phone call from my contact at National Geographic. The White House was hosting it's first ever Maker Faire, and wanted me to go. Maker Faire, known as the "Greatest Show and Tell on Earth", hosts annual gatherings across the globe to showcase the research and things people are working on, a Mecca for DIY'ers. When the President Obama chose to organize the First White House Maker Faire, he looked to his Office of Science and Technology Policy to find people who were making for good, and for the future tomorrow brings.</p>
        <p>Make no mistake, as a 14 year old, I certainly wasn't a headlining act, That was left to researchers building Rovers, Recycled 3D Printers, and Show Stopping Specticles. National Geographic had referred me as an "Honored Maker", someone who had contributed to the Maker and Scientific Community, and had the priviledge of wandering around the White House at looking at all the cool stuff on display, which I was more than capabile of doing.</p>
        <p>The day of I spoke to some amazing people doing research and driving the market forward in creative ways I was totally stumped by, and even found some university researchers using piezo-discs. I also had the chance to meet some scientific royalty, and try to act normal while chit-chatting with Bill Nye. Of course, it all culminated with words by President Obama and others working to foward science in America, and the world. A memorable experience and one I'm honored to be apart of.</p>
