        <p>Being a Boy Scout, especially in New York City, was a privildge. I spent 8 years in the scouts, Graduating Webelos early and becoming a Scout at 10Â½. When it came time to give back to the community as part of my Eagle Project, I wanted to make sure I did something that had real impact and showed who I was, and how scouts was a toolset, not just a set program.</p>
        <p>My project benefited a local assisted living community, specifically housing those with memory related ailments. Working collaboratively with their staff from day one, we workshopped ideas and ultimately came up with a project that both put our 30 boy strong manpower to use, and made it unique as <i>my</i> project. The plan was two-fold, First I would work with managment to put my programming skills to work and create a <a href="">Newsletter Generator</a> that they could use weekly to indivually inform residents about Weather, News, Birthdays, or Intersts residents may have a hard time remembering. Next, in order to collect all of the data needed in order to feed the algorithms, Scouts would meet 1-1 with each resident to discuss their interests, hear some of their stories, and ultimately provide companionship for a day to a Senior resident.</p>
        <p>Over the course of 4 months, and 100's of man-hours later. Our team of 20 Scouts met with over 75 residents, generated books of data, and delivered software to our partner that met their specifications. After a 7 year scouting journey, I was happy to conclude my time as an active scout with a mark I was proud to leave behind, hopefully providing an enriching experience for both our scouts, the residents, and undoubtedly myself. After council board review, I was granted the rank of Eagle Scout on November 1st, 2017.</p>
