I happened on Prose while making a basic Jekyll site for a non-profit organization I was doing some volunteer work for. They were looking for an online presence that looked bespoke while keeping costs minimal. I could keep pitch in on the design and content, but I wanted to make sure editing, updating, and extending the site would be easy for anyone to do. Since the site was going to be hosted on Github Pages, I was looking for a headless CMS that integrated with Github without needing editors to get into technical details.

As I started to use the site more I noticed bugs and features lacking that I wanted to fix. The project had been stale for a while so I started working on modernizing the project (as it hadn't seen a commit in over 6 years and had many hard breaking dependencies). I was brought onto the core Prose team later that week and have been churning through bugs and features in my free time since.

In a perfect world I'd like to do a full re-write and start from scratch with modern more modular architecture, but I'm not sure if that's in the cards.
