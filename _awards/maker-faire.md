My contact at Nat Geo (Samantha) ([check out how I met them]({% link _awards/nat-geo.md %})) let me know that President Obama was hosting the first-ever White House Maker Faire and that his senior Science and Technology Policy advisor, Danielle Carnival, had reached out to Nat Geo to see if they knew any makers the White House may want to invite. I was honored that Samantha thought to include my name on the list and even more so when I was invited as an **Honored Maker** (which is fancy speak for an attendee, and most likely be the only time Bill Nye and I are grouped together 😅).

As an attendee, I browsed all of the amazing projects on showcase, sat in on the president's address on the "state of making", and met all sorts of awesome people ranging from corporate big wigs shaping the future of consumer & maker technology to childhood heroes. 

I'm sure I will regret this decision quite a lot but the bragging rights are too hard to pass up. Enjoy these very washed-out photos of 13 year old me absolutely killing the game.
