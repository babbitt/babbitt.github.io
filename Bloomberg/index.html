                                <h2>Bloomberg LP</h2>
                                <p>  For the last three summers (and an upcoming fourth) I've been lucky enough to work with the great minds at Bloomberg LP.
                                     While there, I was integrated into three different teams over the years. Working in Fixed Income, Communication Channels, and Internal Applications.
                                </p>
                                <br>

                                <p>
                                    My first year at Bloomberg I worked within a small team that had identified a break in their development workflow. I worked with them to implement a financial validation layer which connected their development pipeline into one continuous process, and is still in use today.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <h3 class="subtitle">Summer 2018 - Communication Channels - New York</h3>

                                <p>
                                    My second summer I was placed in Bloomberg's communications department within the proprietary messaging platform team (Instant Bloomberg). Working with a mentor, I developed two client facing features which are in production. I also delved into the core app functionality to fix bugs and improve testing suite performance by over 25%.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <h3 class="subtitle">Summer 2019 - Internal Applications - New York</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Last summer I was embedded within the internal and customer support department to re-develop a telephony service application. Working with users, I was responsible for the UI/UX development in addition to functionality. In 8 weeks I delivered a functioning prototype which was ready for redeployment in production applications.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <span class="subtitle"><h3 class="subtitle"  style="display: inline-block">Summer 2019 - ? - London</h3><img src="http://flags.ox3.in/svg/gb.svg" style="width: 3em;float: inherit;padding: 0;margin: 0 0 0 3px"/></h3></span>

                                    I'm excited to see what the summer holds!
