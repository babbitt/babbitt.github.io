I"L<p>I currently attend the College of Engineering at Binghamton University where I am majoring in Computer Science. Just to get it out of the way, here’s some coursework I’ve taken you may be wondering about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming &amp; Hardware Fundamentals (Compilers &amp; Low-Level Programming)</li>
  <li>Programming with Objects &amp; Data Structures (Object Oriented Programming)</li>
  <li>Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (Algorithms + Data Structures)</li>
  <li>Architecture from a Programmers Perspective (Architecture)</li>
</ul>

<p>some other courses I’ve thoroughly enjoyed but not as applicable to my career include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ethical Societal &amp; Global Issues Computing</li>
  <li>Philosophical Law &amp; Justice</li>
  <li>Intro to Anthropology</li>
  <li>Scuba</li>
  <li>Yiddish</li>
</ul>

<p>I attempt to use my time here as an experiment to not only see what I may be doing in my career, but what other budding interests I have and how I can fold them into my passion. As you may be able to tell I’m a big fan of not only computing, but how we interact with computing, both from a philosophical, and physiological perspective. I hope to find some free time and think more broadly about how this impacts not only the work we do as Software Engineers but also as consumers and users of the products we create.</p>
