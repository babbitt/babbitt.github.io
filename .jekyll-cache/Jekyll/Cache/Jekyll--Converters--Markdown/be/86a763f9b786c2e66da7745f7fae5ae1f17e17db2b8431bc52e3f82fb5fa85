I"F<p>Walk-To was the brainchild of <a href="https://samuelpiltch.com/">Samuel Piltch</a> and I’s to solve a problem we face every day, commuting.</p>

<p>As an NYC high school student, there’s a daily battle between you and the subway in the morning. Your goal is always to maximize your sleep, and the MTA’s goal is to somehow change every aspect of their service every day (I kid). The result is disgruntled students always looking for the day’s most efficient route, dodging both planned and unplanned service changes to make it school the quickest.</p>

<p>Walk-To was Sam and I’s prototype solution to ease one aspect of the constant battle, visualization. Our app aimed to give you one simple metric. “Can I make that train?”</p>

<p>We accomplish this by visualizing the time until a train arrives at a given station by drawing a radius of how far away from the station you could be and still make the train. Did that sentence make a little sense to you as it did when I read it the first time? I get it, here’s an example:</p>

<div class="photo-group">
    <picture><source srcset="/generated/assets/img/projects/hackathon/walk-to/screenshot-400-3902f85a4.webp 400w, /generated/assets/img/projects/hackathon/walk-to/screenshot-598-3902f85a4.webp 598w" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/generated/assets/img/projects/hackathon/walk-to/screenshot-400-50e6cc54f.png 400w, /generated/assets/img/projects/hackathon/walk-to/screenshot-598-50e6cc54f.png 598w" type="image/png"><img style="max-width: 40rem" src="/generated/assets/img/projects/hackathon/walk-to/screenshot-598-50e6cc54f.png" alt=""'Gig' page""></picture>

</div>

<p>To explain via an example. If you were at the corner of Barclay and Broadway when this screenshot was taken, You’d be able to make the 2 and 4 trains, but you’d have a hard time running to the 6 in time.</p>
