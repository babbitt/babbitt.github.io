I"R<p>In the spring of 2019 I became involved in our campus radio station, Harpur Radio Workshop, better known by its callsign, WHRW. WHRW was started in the 1950s by a loose group of students and in the time since has blossomed into a 150+ member strong autonomous organization. We are one of few free-form radio stations, meaning that we have no obligations to advertisers (we have none), management, or any other external source (besides abiding by FCC regulations). Whoever is at the board is in control of what goes on air and no one else. We are also a physical-media-only station, meaning that our entire library is either on vinyl, cd, tape, cassette, or some other physical media that sits in our record library, the largest private collection in the north-east. We “keep it lit” 24/7, tune in @ <a href="https://whrw.fm/">whrw.fm</a>.</p>
