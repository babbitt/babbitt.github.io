I"w<p>Due to the competitive nature of our program &amp; and the size of our high school, we often had up to 200 applicants each year to join our team. While we wish we couldâ€™ve accommodated all of them ( and we did hold supplemental outreach programs ) the reality is that reach year we could only choose 5-15 applicants. The reality of tracking and assessing 200 people with a 40 person team is not easy, especially on paper. Just the task alone of checking everyone in for attendance regularly took 10-15 minutes. In order to streamline this process, I created Roboswipe. Similar to our scanners to get into the building in the morning. Students would scan their ID card at the door and their attendance would automatically be recorded online. We also later expanded the system to include the ability to turn in programming homework assignments we gave to our software candidates.</p>
