I"å<p>Being a Boy Scout, especially in New York City, was a privilege. I spent 8 years in scouts, starting as a WEBELOWS and transitioning to a full-fledged scout at 10Â½. When it came time to give back to the community as part of my Eagle Project, I wanted to make sure I did something that had a real impact, showed who I was and how scouts were a tool-set, not just a curriculum. This is all to say I wanted to make sure I didnâ€™t just paint another wall or plant another garden.</p>
