I"O<p>As a kid, I always loved the theatre, but mostly because of all the cool “tech” that powered a performance. I would always be looking away from the stage, trying to see how the lights were set up, or what speakers were where. When I got to college and heard that we had a student-run event production company, I was hooked.</p>
