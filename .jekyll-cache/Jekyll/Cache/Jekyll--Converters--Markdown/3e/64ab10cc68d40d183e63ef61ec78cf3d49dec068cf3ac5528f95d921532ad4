I"¬<p>Brooklyn Technical High School, or just Tech, is the largest high school in America with over 6,000 students and a single building campus spanning a full city block situated in Fort Greene, minutes from Downtown Brooklyn.</p>

<p>I was privileged to call Tech my home for four years in which I arguably learned more than I ever had in my life. The breadth and depth of the people, classes offered, and experiences afforded to me were unlike anything Iâ€™ve experienced since.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of participating in Tech Robotics, The Largest NHS Chapter in the country, and being one of the first graduating classes of the newly formed Mechatronics and Robotics Major.</p>
