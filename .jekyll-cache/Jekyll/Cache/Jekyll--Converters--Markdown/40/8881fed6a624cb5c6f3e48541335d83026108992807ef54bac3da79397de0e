I"÷<p><a href="https://core.binghamton.edu/">CoRE</a>, or the Computer, Robotics, and Engineering house at Binghamton University is a living community on campus. Weâ€™re a group of 28 students that either major or just generally enjoy the aforementioned subjects and share a tight-knit community on campus. Although weâ€™re considered a â€œlearning communityâ€ on campus (and we do have a spring semester capstone class), that doesnâ€™t come without a little mattress jousting and other shenaniganry.</p>
