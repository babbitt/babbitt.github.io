I"3<p>One of my earlier web dev projects. QR scout was a mobile robotics scouting platform built for network efficiency. At robotics competitions usually, the large amount of people and bots means that the internet is slow to non-existent. A large part of the strategic play of robotics is getting info about other teams’ performances. This is normally done using paper and good ol’ crunching numbers due to the technical limitations of the venue. However, we attempted to get around these network requirements by bypassing all data via QR code. The Scouters (1 per robot) would collect data during the match, and then have their info scanned by a lead scout with a tablet that would then have access to all data to tabulate and view for strategy. The product was a little janky but in the end, worked quite well.</p>
