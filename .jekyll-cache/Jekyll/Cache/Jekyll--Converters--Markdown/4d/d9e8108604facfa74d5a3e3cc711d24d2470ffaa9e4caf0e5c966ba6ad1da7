I"}<p>In February 2020 (right before the COVID-19 lock-down), three of my peers and I headed to Dallas, TX to compete against 14 other universities in the Deloitte Foundation Cyber Threat Competition. Over 2 tense days, we participated in a CTF-like technical competition as well as a paneled business presentation, ultimately nabbing a 2nd place finish and a $4,000 scholarship.</p>
