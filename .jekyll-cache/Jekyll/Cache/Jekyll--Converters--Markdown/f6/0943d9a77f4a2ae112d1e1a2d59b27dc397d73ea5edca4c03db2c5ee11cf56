I"…<p>The Binghamton Trading Post (BTP) started as a mix between an itch I had to push Google Sheets to its limit and a subreddit at our school called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BearcatsMarketplace/">Bearcats Marketplace</a> where people could sell school-related items. My goal was to unite these two thoughts and create a Google Sheet to unite all of Binghamtonâ€™s used market.</p>
