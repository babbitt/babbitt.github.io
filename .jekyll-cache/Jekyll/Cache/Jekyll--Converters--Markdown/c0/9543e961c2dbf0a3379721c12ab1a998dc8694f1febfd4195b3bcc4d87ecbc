I"´<p>When I participated in my 7th-grade school science fair, I expected it to start and end with that. However, following a conference my science teacher attended, she pushed me to submit my project to National Geographic as part of their Engineering Exploration Challenge. The gist of the challenge was to find a way for Nat-Geo photographers to recharge their gear while in the field, and do so in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
